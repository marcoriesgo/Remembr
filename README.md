# Project 2 - Remembr

## Project:

Remembr is an application for seniors suffering from early stage dementia, caretakers, and medical professionals in Los Angeles. Through the application, members can find professionals they could potentially hire and other users that are on a similar journey, discover new senior friendly places to visit and share their own favorites, and see or share upcoming senior friendly events where they can feel part of a community as they age and go through memory loss.
